Rails Application Boilerplate
=============================

I was discussing with my colleague and friend [Yann Moisan](https://github.com/YannMoisan) about how people used to bootstrap their app before joining hackatons. I then realized that I always did the same thing when bootstraping a new project:

- Create a Ruby on Rails application.
- Install the Twitter Bootstrap Gen 
- Generate my layout
- Install Rspec for Rails, Webrat and Factory Girl
- Setup a user signin / signup thing
