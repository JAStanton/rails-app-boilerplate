Rails Application Boilerplate
=============================

Rails Application Boilerplate is a small, ready to code, Rails application. It was intended to avoid repeating the same process for every Rails project I start.

It provides:

–   A configured Rails application 
-   A Twitter Bootstrap fluid layout
–   A full registration / authentication part
-   A few helpers to be used everywhere in the application
–   An application params system
-   Rspec, Webrat and Factory Girl for testing

The idea came while discussing with my colleague and friend [Yann Moisan](https://github.com/YannMoisan) about hackatons and how some people actually bootstraped their application befor the event so they won't have to spend 10+ minutes building what can be easily done before. That's how I realized that I did the same thing for every project I start, this leading to never finished projects.

# Application init

Fork or clone Rails App Boilerplate from Github:

  $ git clone git://github.com/fdv/rails-app-boilerplate.git

Copy config/database.yml.yourdatabase to config/database.yml and fill in your credential.

Then run:

  $ bundle install
  $ rake db:create
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rake db:seed
  $ ./scripts/rails server

Now, you can access your application in your Web browser at `127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Playing with application settings

`params.xxx`: calls the xxx application param. Application params are stored in a serialized array so they can be added / removed without changing the data model.

Calling `<%= params.app_name_ %>` in the views displays the application name.

In your controllers:

  app = App.default
  app.foo = "bar"
  app.save

Creates the `foo` param for the application.

`App.default` method loads the first and only App record from the database. App is created at application init.
