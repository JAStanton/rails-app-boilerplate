Rails Application Boilerplate
=============================

Rails Application Boilerplate is a small, ready to code, Rails application. It was intended to avoid repeating the same process for every Rails project I start.

It provides:

– A configured Rails application 
- A Twitter Bootstrap fluid layout
– A full registration / authentication part
- A few helpers to be used everywhere in the application
– An application params system
- Rspec, Webrat and Factory Girl for testing

The idea came while discussing with my colleague and friend [Yann Moisan](https://github.com/YannMoisan) about hackatons and how some people actually bootstraped their application befor the event so they won't have to spend 10+ minutes building what can be easily done before. That's how I realized that I did the same thing for every project I start, this leading to never finished projects.
